# Graph Sparsifications using Neural Network Assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search

Graph neural networks have been successful for machine learning, as well as for combinatorial and graph problems such as the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem. We describe an approach for computing graph sparsifiers by combining a graph neural network and Monte Carlo Tree Search. We first train a graph neural network that takes as input a partial solution and  proposes a new node to be added as output. This neural network is then used in a Monte Carlo search to compute a sparsifier. The proposed method consistently outperforms several standard approximation algorithms on many different types of graphs and often finds the optimal solution.
